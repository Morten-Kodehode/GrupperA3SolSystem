    name: "Mercury",
    image: "images/mercury.png",
    info: `Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun. The smallest planet 
    in the Solar System, Mercury has no natural satellites. 
    The dominant geological features are impact craters or basins with ejecta 
    blankets, the remains of early volcanic activity including magma flows, 
    and lobed ridges or rupes that were probably produced by a period of 
    contraction early in the planet's history. Mercury's very tenuous atmosphere 
    consists of solar-wind particles trapped by Mercury's magnetic field, as 
    well as atoms blasted off its surface by the solar wind. Its relatively 
    large iron core and thin mantle have not yet been adequately explained.`,
  },
  {
    name: "Venus",
    image: "images/venus.png",
    info: `Venus is close in size to Earth and, like Earth, 
    has a thick silicate mantle around an iron core, a substantial atmosphere, 
    and evidence of internal geological activity. It is much drier than Earth, 
    and its atmosphere is ninety times as dense. Venus has no natural satellites. 
    It is the hottest planet, with surface temperatures over 400 Â°C, mainly due to 
    the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The planet has no magnetic 
    field that would prevent depletion of its substantial atmosphere, which suggests 
    that its atmosphere is being replenished by volcanic eruptions.`,
  },
  {
    name: "Earth",
    image: "images/earth.png",
    info: `Earth is the largest and densest of the inner planets, the only one known 
    to have current geological activity, and the only place where life is known to exist. 
    Its liquid hydrosphere is unique among the terrestrial planets, and it is the only 
    planet where plate tectonics has been observed. Earth's atmosphere is radically different 
    from those of the other planets, having been altered by the presence of life to contain 
    21% free oxygen. The planetary magnetosphere shields the surface from solar and cosmic 
    radiation, limiting atmospheric stripping and maintaining habitability. It has one natural 
    satellite, the Moon, the only large satellite of a terrestrial planet in the Solar System.`,
  },
  {
    name: "Mars",
    image: "images/mars.png",
    info: `Mars is smaller than Earth and Venus. It has an atmosphere of mostly 
    carbon dioxide with a surface pressure of 6.1 millibars; roughly 0.6% of that of Earth but 
    sufficient to support weather phenomena. Its surface, peppered with volcanoes, such as Olympus 
    Mons, and rift valleys, such as Valles Marineris, shows geological activity that may have 
    persisted until as recently as 2 million years ago. It's red colour comes from iron oxide (rust) 
    in its soil. Mars has two tiny natural satellites (Deimos and Phobos) thought to be either captured 
    asteroids, or ejected debris from a massive impact early in Mars's history.`,

  {
    name: "Jupiter",
    image: "images/jupiter.png",
    info: `Jupiter, is 2.5 times the mass of all the other planets put together. 
    It is composed largely of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter's strong internal heat creates 
    semi-permanent features in its atmosphere, such as cloud bands and the Great Red Spot. 
    The planet possesses a 4.2-14 Gauss strength magnetosphere that spans 22-29 million km, 
    making it, in certain respects, the largest object in the Solar System. Jupiter has 80 known 
    satellites. The four largest, Ganymede, Callisto, Io, and Europa, are called the Galilean 
    moons: they show similarities to the terrestrial planets, such as volcanism and internal 
    heating. Ganymede, the largest satellite in the Solar System, is larger than Mercury; 
    Callisto is almost as large.`,
  },
  {
    name: "Saturn",
    image: "images/saturn3.png",
    info: `Saturn, distinguished by its extensive ring system, has several similarities 
    to Jupiter, such as its atmospheric composition and magnetosphere. Although Saturn 
    has 60% of Jupiter's volume, it is less than a third as massive. Saturn 
    is the only planet of the Solar System that is less dense than water. The rings of 
    Saturn are made up of small ice and rock particles. Saturn has 83 confirmed satellites 
    composed largely of ice. Two of these, Titan and Enceladus, show signs of geological 
    activity; they, as well as five other Saturnian moons (Iapetus, Rhea, Dione, Tethys, 
    and Mimas), are large enough to be round. Titan, the second-largest moon in the Solar 
    System, is bigger than Mercury and the only satellite in the Solar System to have a 
    substantial atmosphere.`,
  },
  {
    name: "Uranus",
    image: "images/uranus.png",
    info: `Uranus, has the lowest mass of the outer planets. Uniquely among 
    the planets, it orbits the Sun on its side; its axial tilt is over ninety degrees to 
    the ecliptic. This gives the planet extreme seasonal variation as each pole points toward 
    and then away from the Sun. It has a much colder core than the other giant planets and 
    radiates very little heat into space. As a consequence, it has the coldest planetary 
    atmosphere in the Solar System. Uranus has 27 known satellites, the largest ones being 
    Titania, Oberon, Umbriel, Ariel, and Miranda. Like the other giant planets, it possesses 
    a ring system and magnetosphere.`,
  },
  {
    name: "Neptune",
    image: "images/neptune.png",
    info: `Neptune, though slightly smaller than Uranus, is more massive and 
    hence more dense. It radiates more internal heat than Uranus, but not as much as Jupiter 
    or Saturn. Neptune has 14 known satellites. The largest, Triton, is geologically active, 
    with geysers of liquid nitrogen. Triton is the only large satellite with a retrograde orbit, 
    which indicates that it did not form with Neptune, but was probably captured from the Kuiper 
    belt. Neptune is accompanied in its orbit by several minor planets, termed Neptune trojans, 
    that either lead or trail the planet by about one-sixth of the way around the Sun, positions 
    known as Lagrange points.`,
